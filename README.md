# Playfair-Project [german] #
Welcome to the Playfair-Project, a Java application designed to help students improve their programming skills. This project includes a simple Input/Output (IO) system and an encryption/decryption algorithm based on the Playfair encryption method.

## Key Features: ##
* **Learn Encryption Basics:**  The Playfair-Project provides a practical opportunity for students to understand and implement encryption. The algorithm is based on the Playfair encryption technique, offering a hands-on learning experience.

* **User-Friendly IO System:** Explore the project's straightforward Input/Output system, making it easy to interact with the encryption and decryption processes.

## Getting Started: ##

To begin exploring the Playfair-Project, follow these steps:

### For the Challenge Seekers: ###

1. **Download:** Choose either the [BlueJ Version](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20-%20BLUEJ%20Version.zip) or the [.jar Version](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption.jar) file.
2. **Open in Your IDE:** If you picked the BlueJ version, open it in BlueJ. For the .jar Version, use your preferred IDE.
3. **Start Coding:** Dive into the "Verschluesselung" class and embark on the coding challenge.

### For All Other Use Cases: ###

1. **Download the Solution:** Choose either the [BlueJ Solution](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20Solution%20-%20BLUEJ%20Version.zip) or the [.jar Solution](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20Solution.jar) file. The application is also available as individual **java files**: [Frame](), [Panel](), and [Encryption]()
2. **Open in Your IDE:** If you picked the BlueJ version, launch it in BlueJ. For the .jar Version, utilize your preferred IDE.
3. **Explore or Adapt:** Delve into any of the classes and adapt them to suit your specific use case or explore the existing functionality.


Feel free to choose the path that aligns with your goals, whether it's tackling the challenge or leveraging the solution for other purposes. Happy coding!

## How to Contribute: ##
Contributions are welcome. Contributions are welcome! Whether you're a student looking to improve existing features or an experienced developer suggesting enhancements, your input is valuable.

## Disclaimer: ##

**Note:** The Playfair encryption algorithm implemented in this project has inherent limitations. It is crucial to be aware of the following constraints:

0. **Language Barrier:** The user interface is in german, as well as all the code comments and description in the "Verschluesslung" class.

1. **Exclusion of the Letter 'J':** Playfair encryption, as applied in this project, excludes the letter 'J' due to historical implementations. This limitation may affect the representation of certain text and impacts the key space.

2. **Password Size Limitation:** For simplicity and practicality in this educational context, the password size is intentionally limited to 50 characters.

3. **Character Restrictions:** The password is restricted to alpha characters only, excluding the letter 'J'. Any non-alpha characters will not be processed in the encryption or decryption operations.

Users are encouraged to use this project for educational purposes and understand that these limitations are specific characteristics of this implementation. The author disclaims any responsibility for the algorithm's use beyond its intended educational scope.
