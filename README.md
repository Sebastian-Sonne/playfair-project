# Playfair-Project #
Welcome to the Playfair-Project, a Java application designed to help students improve their programming skills. This project includes a simple Input/Output (IO) system and an encryption/decryption algorithm based on the Playfair encryption method.

## Key Features: ##
* **Learn Encryption Basics:**  The Playfair-Project provides a practical opportunity for students to understand and implement encryption. The algorithm is based on the Playfair encryption technique, offering a hands-on learning experience.

* **User-Friendly IO System:** Explore the project's straightforward Input/Output system, making it easy to interact with the encryption and decryption processes.

## Getting Started: ##

Follow these steps to get started with the Playfair-Project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the project structure to understand the IO system and encryption/decryption algorithm.
3. Dive into the code and enhance the encryption/decryption algorithm to reinforce your programming skills.
4. Experiment with different inputs to observe how the algorithm works and gain a practical understanding of Playfair encryption.
