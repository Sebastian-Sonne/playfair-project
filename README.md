# Playfair-Project [german]#
Welcome to the Playfair-Project, a Java application designed to help students improve their programming skills. This project includes a simple Input/Output (IO) system and an encryption/decryption algorithm based on the Playfair encryption method.

## Key Features: ##
* **Learn Encryption Basics:**  The Playfair-Project provides a practical opportunity for students to understand and implement encryption. The algorithm is based on the Playfair encryption technique, offering a hands-on learning experience.

* **User-Friendly IO System:** Explore the project's straightforward Input/Output system, making it easy to interact with the encryption and decryption processes.

## Getting Started: ##

Follow these steps to get started with the Playfair-Project:
* If you are here for a **challange**
    1. Download either the [BlueJ Version](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20-%20BLUEJ%20Version.zip) or the [.jar Version](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption.jar) file
    2. Open the BLUEJ version in BlueJ or the .jar Version in your IDE of choice
    3. Start coding in the "Verschluesselung" class

* If your are here for **anything else**
    1. Download either the [BlueJ Solution](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20Solution%20-%20BLUEJ%20Version.zip) or the [.jar Solution](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20Solution.jar) file
    2. Open the BLUEJ version in BlueJ or the .jar Version in your IDE of choice
    3. Explore any of the classes and/or use it for your usecase
 
## Disclaimer: ##

**Note:** The Playfair encryption algorithm implemented in this project has inherent limitations. It is crucial to be aware of the following constraints:

1. **Exclusion of the Letter 'J':** Playfair encryption, as applied in this project, excludes the letter 'J' due to historical implementations. This limitation may affect the representation of certain text and impacts the key space.

2. **Password Size Limitation:** For simplicity and practicality in this educational context, the password size is intentionally limited to 50 characters.

3. **Character Restrictions:** The password is restricted to alpha characters only, excluding the letter 'J'. Any non-alpha characters will not be processed in the encryption or decryption operations.

Users are encouraged to use this project for educational purposes and understand that these limitations are specific characteristics of this implementation. The author disclaims any responsibility for the algorithm's use beyond its intended educational scope.
