# Playfair-Project [German] #

Welcome to the Playfair-Project, a Java application designed to enhance students' programming skills. This project features a straightforward Input/Output (IO) system and an encryption/decryption algorithm based on the Playfair encryption method.

## Key Features: ##
* **Learn Encryption Basics:** The Playfair-Project provides a practical opportunity for students to understand and implement encryption using the Playfair technique, offering a hands-on learning experience.

* **User-Friendly IO System:** Explore the project's straightforward Input/Output system, making it easy to interact with the encryption and decryption processes. [Check out the UI outline here](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/UI%20outline.png).

* **Input Error Detection:** An enhanced input error detection tailored to the requirements of the Playfair algorithm is in place.

## Getting Started: ##

### For Challenge Seekers and Educators: ###
1. **Download:**
   - Choose either the [BlueJ Version](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20-%20BLUEJ%20Version.zip) or the [.jar Version](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption.jar) file.
2. **Open in Your IDE:**
   - If you chose the BlueJ version, open it in BlueJ. For the .jar Version, use your preferred IDE.
3. **Start Coding:**
   - Dive into the "Verschluesselung" class and embark on the coding challenge.

### For All Other Use Cases: ###
1. **Download the Solution:**
   - Choose either the [BlueJ Solution](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20Solution%20-%20BLUEJ%20Version.zip) or the [.jar Solution](https://github.com/Sebastian-Sonne/playfair-project/blob/main/Playfair%20Encryption%20Solution.jar) file.
2. **Open in Your IDE:**
   - If you selected the BlueJ version, launch it in BlueJ. For the .jar Version, use your preferred IDE.
3. **Explore or Adapt:**
   - Delve into any of the classes and adapt them to suit your specific use case or explore the existing functionality.

Feel free to choose the path that aligns with your goals, whether it's tackling the challenge or leveraging the solution for other purposes.

## How to Contribute: ##
Contributions are welcome! Whether you're a student looking to improve existing features or an experienced developer suggesting enhancements, your input is valuable. 
* As mentioned in the title, the application is in German. Feel free to **translate** the existing version into an English version of the program. I am open to answering any questions.

## Disclaimer: ##

**Note:** The Playfair encryption algorithm implemented in this project has inherent limitations. It is crucial to be aware of the following constraints:

1. **Language Barrier:** The user interface, code comments, and descriptions in the "Verschluesselung" class are in German.

2. **Character Restrictions:** Both input and passwords are limited to alpha characters only, excluding the letter 'J' due to historical implementation reasons. An **Input Error Detection** mechanism is in place to guarantee a smooth user experience.

3. **Password Size Limitation:** For simplicity and practicality in this educational context, the password size is intentionally limited to 50 characters.

4. **Input Error Detection:** The application includes input error detection to enhance the user experience. Note that this feature is customizable within the project itself to suit specific requirements.

Users are encouraged to use this project for educational purposes and understand that these limitations are specific characteristics of this implementation. The author disclaims any responsibility for the algorithm's use beyond its intended educational scope.
